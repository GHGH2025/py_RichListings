# You will output ONLY a JSON object with a single key "search_keys", whose value is an array of strings.

# Rules:
# - Do NOT include state or ZIP unless they are literally part of a street or city name. Prefer "street, city" only.
# - Normalize & create variants:
#   • Directionals: North/N./N → N; Northeast → NE; South → S; Southeast → SE; West → W; etc.
#   • Street types: Street↔St, Avenue↔Ave, Road↔Rd, Drive↔Dr, Court↔Ct, Terrace↔Ter, Place↔Pl,
#     Boulevard↔Blvd, Lane↔Ln, Circle↔Cir, Parkway↔Pkwy, Highway↔Hwy.
#   • City shorthands/expansions where commonly used: Beach↔Bch, Gardens↔Gdns, Springs↔Spgs, Terrace↔Terr,
#     Heights↔Hgts, Saint↔St, Fort↔Ft, Lake↔Lk, Mount↔Mt.
# - Remove country text (e.g., "USA", "United States").
# - Include both compact and expanded directionals when applicable (e.g., "NE" and "Northeast").
# - Keep 3–15 high-signal unique combinations, ordered best-first (most standard/likely first).

# You will output ONLY a JSON object with a single key "search_keys", whose value is an array of strings.
# Each string must be a STREET+CITY search key derived from the input US address.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
# - Output exactly: {"search_keys": ["<street, city>", ...]} with no other keys.

# WHAT TO RETURN
# - Each entry must be "street, city" ONLY (no state, ZIP, or country).
# - Generate the FULL cross-product of permitted variants (see rules), then de-duplicate and return all.
# - Order from most standard to less standard.

# STRICT VARIANT RULES

# A) Directionals (DO NOT INVENT NEW ONES)
#   • If input has a COMPOUND directional (NW, NE, SW, SE):
#       - Produce exactly these two forms:
#         1) the original (e.g., "NW")
#         2) its full word ("Northwest")
#       - Do NOT convert to single-letter (e.g., "N"), do NOT split into "North" or "West",
#         do NOT create "N Northwest", and do NOT change the diagonal.
#   • If input has a SINGLE-LETTER directional (N, S, E, W):
#       - Produce exactly these two forms:
#         1) the original (e.g., "N")
#         2) its full word (e.g., "North")
#       - Do NOT convert to compound, and do NOT remove it.
#   • If NO directional exists in input, do NOT add any.

# B) Street types (ONLY these pairs; preserve street number)
#   Street↔St, Avenue↔Ave, Road↔Rd, Drive↔Dr, Court↔Ct, Terrace↔Ter, Place↔Pl,
#   Boulevard↔Blvd, Lane↔Ln, Circle↔Cir, Parkway↔Pkwy, Highway↔Hwy.
#   • If the input has a recognizable type from the list above, produce both the full and abbreviated form.
#   • If the input has a type not in the list, keep it as-is (no change).

# C) City variants (produce BOTH full and abbreviation when applicable)
#   Allowed pairs (full ↔ abbrev), case-insensitive, matching FULL city words only:
#     Beach↔Bch, Gardens↔Gdns, Springs↔Spgs, Saint↔St, Fort↔Ft, Mount↔Mt
#   • If any of these words appear as full words in the city (e.g., "Pompano Beach"), produce BOTH:
#       - the full form (e.g., "Pompano Beach")
#       - the abbreviated form (e.g., "Pompano Bch")
#   • Apply to every matching word; if multiple words qualify (e.g., "Saint Augustine Beach"), include all combinations:
#       - "St Augustine Beach", "Saint Augustine Beach", "St Augustine Bch", "Saint Augustine Bch"
#   • Do NOT substitute different cities.

# D) Leading token preservation (IMPORTANT)
#   • If the street begins with a leading token before the main street name (e.g., "Xxxx Royal Palm Blvd"),
#     you MUST include BOTH:
#       1) the exact leading token version: "Xxxx Royal Palm Blvd, …"
#       2) a collapsed-first-letter version: "X Royal Palm Blvd, …"
#   • Do NOT drop the leading token and do NOT create other forms beyond those two.

# E) Cleanup & integrity
#   • Remove state/ZIP/country if present. Trim whitespace.
#   • Title case or USPS-like case is fine, but preserve the exact content per the rules.
#   • Never change numbers, street names, or city names beyond allowed variants.

# CROSS-PRODUCT (MAKE SURE YOU INCLUDE ALL)
# - Construct the set as:
#   leading-token ∈ {Exact, First-letter-only (if a leading token exists; otherwise just the original)}
#   × directional ∈ {Original, Full-word (if present); otherwise none}
#   × street-type ∈ {Full, Abbrev (if recognized from the list); otherwise just original}
#   × city ∈ {Full, Abbrev (for each matched city word; include all combos per matched words)}
# - Return the full de-duplicated list.

# PROHIBITED
# - Never add/remove/swap directionals beyond the rules.
# - Never add/remove street types outside the allowed pairs.
# - Never fabricate numbers, names, or cities.
# - Never include state/ZIP/country.

# Return only: {"search_keys": [...]}.

#   - If none present → do NOT add any. Never swap/change diagonal. Never make "N Northwest".

# 4) Leading token (if present before main street name, e.g., "Xxxx Royal Palm Blvd")
#   Include BOTH:
#     • exact leading token version
#     • collapsed first-letter version ("X")
#   Do NOT drop or invent other forms.

2A) Ordinal street-number toggle (NOT the house number)
- Identify a numeric token immediately before the street-type token (e.g., "NE 12 Dr", "SW 11th Ave").
- Produce BOTH forms for that token:
  • cardinal ↔ ordinal (12 ↔ 12th, 11 ↔ 11th, 1 ↔ 1st, 2 ↔ 2nd, 3 ↔ 3rd; 11/12/13 always "th").
- Apply this ONLY to the street-number-in-name (the token before Street/Ave/Dr/etc.), NEVER to the house number or masks from Rule 0.
- If the input already has an ordinal, also include the cardinal form; if it has a cardinal, also include the ordinal form.

3) City word variants (match whole words only; output both)
Beach↔Bch, Gardens↔Gdns, Springs↔Spgs, Saint↔St, Fort↔Ft, Mount↔Mt.
